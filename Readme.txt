The gesture recognition is a interesting and motivation problem. Though in the era of alexa, cortana which understand text and perform speech recognition. The gesture help to people who cannot talk and want to express something or perform a task. With this as a motivation, I have created a solo project to develop a gesture dataset with noise and have trained a CNN to perform the detection of the gesture. However, the project does not stop here. The built model is utilized to perform a real time classification of hand gesture and using it the laptop keyboard volume controls, brightness are modified. This project is created in a way so that it can be extended to many use case scenarios.

The dataset of hand gesture are contained. The content are not balanced and there can be more than number of images

Gestures created:
1. four
2. l
3. three
4. thumbsup
5. two
6. up

Each image is (70X90) and is a png image. Can we build a recognition system using CNN for this
